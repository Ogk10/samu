The main purpose of this project is to allow the evaluation and verification of the results of the paper entitled "A disembodied developmental robotic agent called Samu BÃ¡tfai". It is our hope that Samu will be the ancestor of developmental robotics chatter bots that will be able to chat in natural language like humans do.
